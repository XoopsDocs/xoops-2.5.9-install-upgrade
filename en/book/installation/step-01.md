# Language Selection

The main XOOPS distribution comes with English support. Support for additional
locales is supplied by [XOOPS Local support sites](http://www.xoops.org/modules/xoopspartners/).
This support can come in the form of a customized distribution, or additional
files to add to the main distribution.

XOOPS translations are maintained on [transifex](https://www.transifex.com/xoops/public/)

If your XOOPS Installer has additional language support, you can select a language here.

Select the "Continue" button to proceed.
