# Configuration Check

*Checking your server configuration* is a review of the environment the
installer is running in.

If any problems are reported in the *Requirements* section, these need to
be corrected, otherwise XOOPS will *not* work.

The *Recommended extensions* section indicates additional PHP extensions
that XOOPS, or XOOPS modules, may use to provide additional functions. You
can proceed with the install, even if extensions are not available. But,
if you can enable these, that is recommended.

After reviewing, select the "Continue" button to proceed.
