Launch the upgrade by pointing your browser to the _upgrade_ directory of your site:

```text
http://example.com/upgrade/
```

This should show a page like this: ![XOOPS Upgrade Startup](../../../.gitbook/assets/upgrade-01.png)

Select the "Continue" button to proceed.

Each "Continue" advances through another patch. Keep continuing until all patches are applied, and the System Module Update page is presented.

## Choosing a Language

The main XOOPS distribution comes with English support. Support for additional locales is supplied by [XOOPS Local support sites](http://www.xoops.org/modules/xoopspartners/). This support can come in the form of a customized distribution, or additional files to add to the main distribution.

XOOPS translations are maintained on [transifex](https://www.transifex.com/xoops/public/)

If your XOOPS Upgrader has additional language support, you can change the language by selecting the language icon in the top menus, and choosing a different language.
